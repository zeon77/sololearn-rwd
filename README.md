## Sololearn - Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every device and every screen size. During this course, we will learn how to build modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. As our course project, we will build a website from scratch and, as a bonus, we will add some functionality to it using JavaScript at the end of the course!
